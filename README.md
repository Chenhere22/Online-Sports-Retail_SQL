# Online Sports Retail Using SQL

# Project Description

The Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue project aims to leverage SQL to analyze product data for an online sports clothing company, ultimately developing strategies to maximize revenue. This project utilizes a variety of SQL techniques, including aggregation, data cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and correlation analysis. The dataset comprises key information such as pricing, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic, presented in different formats like numeric, string, and timestamp.

Key questions addressed in the project include:

- How do Nike and Adidas product price points compare?
- Are there differences in the discounts offered by different brands?
- Is there a correlation between revenue and reviews, and if so, how strong is it?
- Does the length of a product description influence ratings and reviews?
- Are there trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?
- What proportion of the company's inventory consists of footwear, and what is the median revenue generated by these items?
- How does the median revenue of footwear compare to that of clothing products?

To achieve these objectives, you'll apply advanced SQL skills such as aggregation, summarization, truncation, data cleaning, labeling, casting, CTEs, correlation, and working with dates and times. These techniques are all covered in the Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL course.
